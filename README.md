# Noted

The goal of this Golang app is to be a cli. I would like to be able to have a nice way to manage all of my notes, be able to filter them, and use them properly. 

I want to be able to have a config in the base of where I make my notes so that I can add configurations to what I am doing.

I am using Golang and its packages for this project. Most importantly, I am using Cobra for the cli, from https://github.com/spf13/cobra. From the same developer, I am using Viper for the configuration management, from https://github.com/spf13/viper.
